* Title      : Global Warming Adventure Game
* Written by : Adam Czaplewski
* Date       : 3/20/2022
* Description: My goal in that adventure game is to lessen carbon emissions by shopping at the store. 
*              We can also fight Dragon in the battle to win the game, but first, we must purchase 
*              the magic spear from the shop. To obtain the funds needed, we must first meet with
*              the Vizard, who will put our knowledge of the global warming to the test. 
*              We'll be able to buy the spear and kill the monster if we answer the questions correctly. 
*              However, we must proceed with caution because each incorrect response will result
*              in a 1000-unit increase in our carbon level. We shall lose the game when we reach 30000 carbon units.
*              I wish you all best of luck with the game!!!!
